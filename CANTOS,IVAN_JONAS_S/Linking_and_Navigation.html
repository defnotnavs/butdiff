							<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
							<p>The study attempt to investigate the effect of air space between the diffuser basin and the
								resting water level on removal of arsenic by the Arsenic Biosand Filter. In addition, the study
								focused on the determination of general flow curve for the filter , determination of time
								required for volume of water to be filtered and also to comprehend the social acceptance of
								the filter.
								Four filters from Tilakpur VDC of Nawalparasi district were selected for the research..
								Altogether 150 water samples were collected and flow rate of each sample was taken. The
								collected samples were tested for arsenic by using ENPHO arsenic field test kit. Besides this,
								the social acceptance of the filter was evaluated through questionnaire and informal survey.
								To accomplish the objective some hypothesis was set. And the result obtained from the
								research was compared with the hypothesis set. And according to the comparison the result
								and conclusion were made. And thus the result obtained from the research was not according
								to the hypothesis set and this thesis describes the different reasons not satisfying the
								hypothesisThe study attempt to investigate the effect of air space between the diffuser basin and the
								resting water level on removal of arsenic by the Arsenic Biosand Filter. In addition, the study
								focused on the determination of general flow curve for the filter , determination of time
